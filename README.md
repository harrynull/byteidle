# ByteIdle

An idle game made for EMagic Jam / ByteTech 1024 Hackathon @ bytedance.

The story takes place in a (cyberpunk?) society where data is the top
priority for any individual or company. The player will try to earn
as many bytes (which is the currency) as possible for their data empire. 

This project is heavily inspired by other awesome idle games such as
[Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) and
[Realm Grinder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.realmgrinder.google).
If you like this game, you will very likely like them too, so try them out if you
haven't.

This project is written with Vue.js and Semantic UI. I am not really a
frontend developer and do not have much experience with them. Plus it
was written for a hackathon so I don't have ample time optimizing them
either. So please don't judge me for bad code. That said, I have made
some effort to make them readable.
